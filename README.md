My coding assignments from CSE1001 in C.
Each file can be run from 'gcc -o'.

# memory.c
This program creates a randomly generated memory game. You are presented a 4 x 4 square (0 indexed) that you can choose to make a match. The board will display with the attempt or if it is right, it will be shown every time the board is printed. If you get to 8 points, you win the game. 

# ordinals.c
This program will print the Ordinal (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc) from 1 to a given input (less than 65335). A negitive number will exit the program.
Currently, this prints 11th, 12th, 13th for only the 11, 12, 13 and not for all numbers with 11, 12, 13 as the last 2 digits (ex: 1112 prints as 1112th).
